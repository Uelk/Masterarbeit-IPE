\label{chap:introduction}

Before starting to write, please have a look at the \textit{``How to write a thesis at IBT''} slides and the booklet that can both be found in our wiki: \url{https://intern.ibt.uni-karlsruhe.de/wiki/LaTeX_template_for_bachelor_and_master_thesis}.
There are also workshops on that topic held whenever enough new students started. Please ask your supervisor regarding the workshops if you did not talk about it, yet.\\
